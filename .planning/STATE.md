## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dark theme fixes before language support: User prioritized fixing existing flawed feature before adding new functionality
- Browser language detection for default: Better UX than forcing English or Chinese
- localStorage for preferences: Simpler than DB sync, sufficient for v1
- Traditional Chinese (not Simplified): User specified Traditional Chinese explicitly

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 (Content Translation):**
- Traditional Chinese translation quality needs native speaker verification for translations, punctuation, and typography

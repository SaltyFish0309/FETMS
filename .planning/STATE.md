## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Root-based Font Scaling (05-05):** Apply font-size to :root to scale all rem-based UI elements proportionally.
- **Explicit Motion Override (05-05):** Allow users to force-enable motion even if system prefers reduced motion.
- **Targeted Density Scaling (05-03):** Apply density scaling to key elements only (main, cards, common gaps) rather than globally to avoid breaking complex layouts.
- **Proportional Font Scaling via Body (05-02):** Set font-size on body (moved to root in 05-05).
- **Silent Cross-tab Sync (05-01):** Storage events update preferences automatically without user notification.

### Pending Todos

- None - Phase 5 complete.

### Blockers/Concerns
